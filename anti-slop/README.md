# antislop

> **Anti Slop: Rules for AI Coding Agents.** It stops them from generating generic "AI slop" UI and copy, without letting the result turn sterile. It is a **filter, not a style guide**: no prescribed colors, fonts, or layouts. It is not only for building pages: it also writes and audits copy, so AI text stops reading like AI. And it never beautifies on its own; `DESIGN.md` (yours) is where beauty and direction come from.

> **New here? Start with the [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md).** It explains what antislop is and how to install it, from zero.

## What it does

- **38 mandatory rules** (R-01 to R-38) in three tiers: Hard Gate (absolute), Purpose-Gate (technique allowed, reason required), Quality Locks (consistency)
- **A Liveliness Toolkit** with three dials (ENERGY / RHYTHM / MOTION) and a Design Read, so the result is alive and specific, not just "clean"
- **A Delivery Gate**: a mandatory PASS/FAIL report in four blocks, run before anything ships
- **Additive skills**, one per concern, so an agent only loads what a task needs

The core prevents slop but cannot invent direction. `DESIGN.md` (yours) supplies it; a sterile result means the direction was missing, not that the filter failed (R-37).

## See the difference

The same brief, the same page, generated four times over. antislop filters; `DESIGN.md` supplies direction. They are two different jobs, and these are the four results. Copy and code follow as before-and-after pairs instead of four separate builds, because nothing else has to supply direction there.

### UI

Three of the four builds. The first uses neither tool, the second only antislop, the third only `DESIGN.md`.

| **Nothing at all** | **antislop alone** | **`DESIGN.md` alone** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| <a href="assets/compare/ui/without.webp"><img src="assets/compare/ui/without.webp" alt="A generic landing page: a sparkle logo, a NEXT-GEN AI 2.0 beta pill above the headline, and a fake terminal reporting 0.0001ms latency" width="100%"></a> | <a href="assets/compare/ui/w-antislop.webp"><img src="assets/compare/ui/w-antislop.webp" alt="The same page with antislop: honest copy on a restrained dark layout with a single accent colour" width="100%"></a> | <a href="assets/compare/ui/w-design.webp"><img src="assets/compare/ui/w-design.webp" alt="The same page with DESIGN.md only: a photographic hero, with the stat cards still reading 10,000% ROI Synergy Multiplier and a 5.0 rating from 500,000 founders" width="100%"></a> |
| Where most AI output starts: a sparkle logo, a beta pill, and a fake terminal. | Honest, because the filter removed the invented numbers. Plain, because beauty is not its job. | The direction lands, but the slop stays, because `DESIGN.md` directs and does not filter. |

The fourth uses both, and it is the only one of the four that is clean and directed at the same time:

| **antislop + `DESIGN.md`** |
|:--|
| <a href="assets/compare/ui/w-all.webp"><img src="assets/compare/ui/w-all.webp" alt="The same page with antislop and DESIGN.md: a full-bleed illustrated hero with one honest headline and project-specific navigation" width="100%"></a> |
| Honest numbers and a real direction in the same build. The filter removes what should not be there; `DESIGN.md` fills the space that leaves, which is the one thing neither tool manages alone. |

## Install

antislop ships as a set of **standard agent skills** (one folder per skill, holding a `SKILL.md`). The core is always loaded; the other skills load only when the task needs them. This section is the reference: every install command, in one place. [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) walks through them from zero, and its Update and Remove sections cover every route the same way.

### 1. The installer (recommended)

One command, then answer the prompts. It asks which extra skills you want, where to install (this project or everywhere), and which agents you use, then copies the folders. It is also the only route that writes the pointer reloading antislop every session on a project install; a global install relies on the skills loading themselves by description.

```bash
npx antislop-ai
```

To update later, run the same command and choose **Overwrite them** when it finds the existing folders. See [Update](#update).

### 2. The skills directory

antislop is listed on [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop), the open directory for agent skills:

```bash
npx skills add miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
```

This copies the same folders as path 1 and nothing else: no pointer, so antislop reloads by description alone. [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) covers adding the pointer afterwards, and updating or removing this route.

### 3. The plugin (Claude Code)

Add the marketplace once, then install the plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
/plugin install antislop@anti-slop
```

### 4. The plugin (Antigravity)

The same repo is an Antigravity plugin. Install it with the Antigravity CLI:

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
```

### 5. The plugin (Codex)

The same repo is a Codex plugin and marketplace. Add the marketplace once, then install the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
codex plugin add antislop@anti-slop
```

### 6. The plugin (Cursor)

The same repo is a Cursor plugin. Add it as a plugin marketplace with the Cursor Agent CLI:

```bash
agent plugin marketplace add https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
```

Then open **Customize** in Cursor, find **antislop**, and select **Install**, choosing project or user scope.

### 7. The plugin (Kimi Code)

The same repo is a Kimi Code plugin. Install it in a Kimi Code session, then start a new one:

```text
/plugins install https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
```

The URL resolves to the latest release. Kimi Code installs plugins per user, so this covers every project.

### 8. The plugin (Cline)

The same repo is a Cline plugin. Install it with the Cline CLI:

```bash
cline plugin install https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop.git
```

The plugin ships no tools and no hooks. Its whole payload is the `skills/` folder it bundles, which Cline discovers on install. This has to be said plainly: Cline's own documentation limits plugins to the SDK, the CLI, and Kanban, and says the feature does not apply to the VS Code and JetBrains extensions yet. So this door covers a Cline CLI install and not an editor install, and the installer in path 1 is the route for an editor.

### 9. The package (Pi)

The same repo is a Pi package. Pi reads a `pi` key in this repository's root `package.json`, which points at the `skills/` folder, so the install is one command:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
```

That writes the package declaration to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`, which covers every project. Add `-l` to write it to this project's `.pi/settings.json` instead, where it applies to this repository only and loads after you grant project trust.

### 10. The plugin (Oh My Pi)

The same repo is an Oh My Pi plugin and marketplace. Oh My Pi reads the catalog this repository keeps at `.omp-plugin/marketplace.json`, so the only Oh My Pi file here is that catalog: the plugin's manifest is the `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` the Claude Code door already ships, and nothing is copied into your project. Add the marketplace once, then install the plugin:

```bash
omp plugin marketplace add miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
omp plugin install antislop@anti-slop
```

Or from inside an active Oh My Pi session:

```text
/marketplace add miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
/marketplace install antislop@anti-slop
```

The install is per user by default, which covers every project. Add `--scope project` to keep it inside the active project instead.

### Where the skills live

Every skill is a folder of the open Agent Skills standard (`<name>/SKILL.md`), so it drops into any agent that reads the standard. The installer (path 1) installs into whichever of these you use, creating the folder if it is missing:

| Agent | Reads antislop from |
|-------|---------------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` |
| Codex | `.codex/skills/` |
| Antigravity | `.agents/skills/` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` |
| Cline | `.cline/skills/` |
| Amp | `.agents/skills/` |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/skills/` |
| Hermes | `.hermes/skills/` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.agents/skills/` |
| Kimi Code | `.agents/skills/` |
| Pi | `.pi/skills/` |

The Gemini CLI row is legacy support: Antigravity replaced it, but the installer still writes there for existing setups.

Antigravity, Copilot, Kimi Code, and Amp share one folder. Copilot also reads `.github/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`, and Kimi Code also reads `.kimi-code/skills/`, but the installer writes the folder they have in common, so picking them together installs antislop once.

Cline, Amp, and Pi each keep a folder of their own and still read one the installer writes. Cline loads `.cline/skills/`, Amp the shared `.agents/skills/`, and Pi `.pi/skills/`, and all three also load a second folder the installer writes: Cline and Amp take `.claude/skills/`, Pi takes the shared `.agents/skills/`. So installing Cline or Amp alongside Claude Code, or Pi alongside Antigravity, Copilot, Kimi Code, or Amp, puts the same names in two folders that agent reads, and the installer names that collision. Cline and Amp also resolve a collision that comes from scope in the same unusual direction, and their own documentation is the source: a global skill outranks a project one, so a stale global install silently wins over a fresh project one. Pi settles its collisions the other way round, in code rather than in documentation: project `.pi/skills/` beats the shared `.agents/skills/`, and it beats the user-level `~/.pi/agent/skills/` as well, and a duplicate name is reported with the copy it kept and the copy it dropped. The rest of the agents here do not settle it.

Those are the project paths. A global install writes the same folder under your home directory, with five exceptions: OpenCode writes to `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, Antigravity to `~/.gemini/config/skills/`, Codex to `~/.agents/skills/`, the user-level folder Codex documents in place of its own `~/.codex/skills/`, Amp to `~/.config/agents/skills/`, and Pi to `~/.pi/agent/skills/`. Copilot, OpenCode, Kimi Code, and Pi read that home-level folder too, so it is where a global install reaches them.

Two agents need one extra step after a project install, and they are not the same step. Hermes will not load skills out of a cloned repository until you run `hermes skills trust` once in that project, a command of its own. Pi has no such command: it asks you to trust the project on the first run, and `/trust` saves the answer for later sessions.

### Manual (single file, no packaging)

The core `antislop.md` alone is a complete filter you can paste into any chat window. Download it and tell your agent to read it; the First-Run wizard inside it installs skills the manual way:

```bash
curl -o antislop.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop/main/antislop.md
```

## Update

antislop does not update itself and nothing tells you a release is out. Every route updates by running its own command again. If you installed through the installer or the skills directory, one command replaces whatever is already there, in this project and in your home directory, and asks nothing:

```bash
npx antislop-ai --update
```

It prints the release it replaced beside the one it wrote. It cannot touch a plugin install, because a plugin keeps a copy of its own under the agent that installed it, so it names the exact command for any plugin door it finds on your machine. The Pi package is outside its reach for the same reason: the declaration lives in Pi's own settings file, not in a skills folder.

| Route | Update it with |
|-------|----------------|
| The installer | `npx antislop-ai`, then **Overwrite them**. It prints the version on disk next to the one it carries. |
| The skills directory | `npx skills add miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop` |
| The plugin (Claude Code) | `claude plugin update antislop@anti-slop` |
| The plugin (Antigravity) | `agy plugin install https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop` |
| The plugin (Codex) | `codex plugin marketplace upgrade anti-slop` |
| The plugin (Cursor) | `agent plugin marketplace update https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop` |
| The plugin (Kimi Code) | `/plugins install https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop` |
| The plugin (Cline) | `cline plugin install https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop.git --force` |
| The package (Pi) | `pi update --extensions` |
| The plugin (Oh My Pi) | `omp plugin marketplace update anti-slop` then `omp plugin upgrade antislop@anti-slop` |
| Manual | download `antislop.md` again |

Skills load when a session starts, so start a new one afterwards. To see which version you are on, open the `VERSION` file in the installed `antislop` folder, or ask your agent. [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md#update) covers each route step by step.

## Skills

| Skill | What it covers | Ships in |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| antislop | The core filter: rules, tiers, Delivery Gate, liveliness | v3.0.0 |
| antislop-ui | UI / visual: layout, color, components, decoration, motion, structure | v2.2.0 |
| antislop-copywriting | Copy & text: headlines, CTAs, tone, fake stats, anti-AI-writing patterns, markdown hygiene | v2.3.0 |
| antislop-human | Human: contrast (with the checker), keyboard, focus, states | v2.4.0 |
| antislop-layoutmobile | Responsive / mobile: reflowing across screen widths (phone to desktop), breakpoints, grids, overflow, tap targets | v2.5.0 |
| antislop-code | Code comments: remove generic AI-slop comments, keep the valuable ones, never touch the code | v3.1.0 |

Pick what matches the work:

- UI work → antislop-ui
- Copy work → antislop-copywriting
- People work → antislop-human
- Responsive layout work → antislop-layoutmobile
- Code comments work → antislop-code
- More than one kind of work → install several
- None → the core alone is a complete filter

## Usage modes

antislop is used one of two ways, chosen at the start of a session:

- **During** guides the work while it is built, ending with the Delivery Gate. Use it when building new UI.
- **After** audits finished work: a numbered findings list, you approve which to fix, then a follow-up report. Use it to clean up existing output.

## Roadmap

**v3.2.18** is the current release.

- **Oh My Pi is a plugin door.** It reads the marketplace catalog at `.omp-plugin/marketplace.json`, so `omp plugin marketplace add miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop` follows this repo directly, with nothing copied into your project.
- **The door is live, not assumed.** It was verified against Oh My Pi 18.3.2 on a real install: the marketplace was added from this repository, the plugin installed, and all six skills landed in the plugin's folder. The version Oh My Pi reported came from this catalog's own `version` field.
- **The manifest that came with the contribution is gone.** Oh My Pi resolves a plugin's manifest from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, a root `plugin.json`, or `package.json`, and never from `.omp-plugin/`, so that file was removed rather than kept as decoration.

Every earlier release, and what comes next, is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## FAQ

### Is antislop a style guide?

No, a filter. It does not prescribe colors, fonts, or layouts. It rejects technique without purpose and requires liveliness; direction is yours.

### Which agents does it work with?

All of them, but the install paths differ:

- **The installer and the skills directory** support Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, OpenCode, Cursor, Cline, Amp, Gemini CLI, Hermes, GitHub Copilot, Kimi Code, and Pi (the installer detects each agent's skill folder). These are the recommended paths.
- **The plugins** are per-agent doors: the Claude Code marketplace plugin (path 3), the Antigravity plugin (path 4), the Codex plugin (path 5), the Cursor plugin (path 6), the Kimi Code plugin (path 7), the Cline plugin (path 8), and the Oh My Pi plugin (path 10), all installed from the same repo.
- **The Pi package** (path 9) is the one route that is not a plugin or a folder copy: Pi reads the `pi` key in this repository's root `package.json`.
- **The single file** (`antislop.md`) works with any agent that reads plain Markdown, including a plain chat window.

The packaged skills use the open Agent Skills standard (folder per skill), so they drop into any tool that reads the standard.

### What is a "skill"?

A folder that goes deeper into one concern (UI, copywriting, accessibility, and so on), holding a `SKILL.md` with its rules. It references the core rules by number and never duplicates them, so adding a skill does not change the core.
